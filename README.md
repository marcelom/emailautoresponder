Email Auto Responder
====================

Email Auto Responder for Postfix.

The Python script was made to assist in the email migration for LBRE @ Stanford. It takes a message in the stdin and a name as argument.

It replies the message back to the sender along with a custom message (hard coded into the script).

If you have any questions or comments, please contact me and I will be more than happy to help !
